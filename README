The simulator takes the following command-line arguments:
Usage: ./csim -s <s> -E <E> -b <b> -t <tracefile>
• -s <s>: Number of set index bits (S = 2s is the number of sets) 
• -E <E>: Associativity (number of lines per set)
• -b <b>: Number of block bits (B = 2b is the block size)
• -t <tracefile>: Name of the valgrind trace to replay


Sample run: ./csim -v -s 4 -E 1 -b 4 -t traces/yi.trace
Output: hits:4 misses:5 evictions:3 dirty_evicted:32 dirty_active:16 double_refs:4
